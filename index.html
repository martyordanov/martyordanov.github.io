            <h2> I was very surprised that anyone actually liked it </h2>
            <h3> Enough to buy it, at least!</h3>
            <p>I Enjoyed the process of making it, it was quite informative and
            productive for the benefit of improving my wall plotter.</p>

            <p>It showed me that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It can be fun to let go of control,</il>
                <li>For timelapse videos, a big structure in the drawing creation 
                    looks quite good,</il>
                <li>Experimenting and enjoying the process is top prio!</il>
                <li>Доста е важно фонта да има и кирлица!</il>
            </ul>
